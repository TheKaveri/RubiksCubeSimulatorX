# Rubik's Cube Simulator by Jimmy George Varughese

## FAQs:

### Basic Overview:
- What the application does?

The application simulates a **3x3 Rubiks Cube** and allows the user to interact with it virtually.
The program has both a console based interface and a JavaSwing GUI. Additionally, it uses JSON for persistence.

- Who can use it?

*Anybody* who is interested in Rubik's Cubes can use it.

- Why is this project of interest to me?

I found puzzles like the Rubiks Cube pretty intriguing since I was a child, and I thought it would be awesome to code it.

### Features:

The user can:
- View all the faces of the cube simultaneously.
- Manually solve/do any number of moves on the cube while having the ability to undo, redo or reset the moves.
- Shuffle the cube.
- View all the moves performed on the cube.
- Save the cube state to a JSON file.
- Load the previously stored cube state to the program.
- As a user, I want to be able to set a custom face permutation to the cube. (only on console UI)

- *Coming soon:* An optimal solver, based on the concept of neural networks, that will solve the cube in 20 or fewer moves.


    Note:
    This project is the improved version of my 2nd year personal project (dated 1st Dec 2022) for the 
    course CPSC210.
